Establish a series of patrols to impose our will on the nearby area. Locate, fix and destroy enemy groups and camps. Interdict enemy movements with fire. Win the support of the local population by securing towns.

		Establish a presence in this stretch of the Hazar-Kot - bringing neutral towns to our side and establishing security for future development projects. Ensure as few casualties as possible.

player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["Situation","
The Hazar-Kot valley is inhabited by an ancient, tribal people known as the Pashtuns. This is the heart of the insurgency in Afghanistan - as the local Pashtun Taliban, aided by foreign fighters, contest all major population centers. Expect no area outside of the wire to be secure. The Taliban operate in small groups, pressuring locals to support their insurgency. Larger groups are often coordinated by foreign fighters. Groups are armed with small arms, heavy and light machine guns, and small amounts of RPGs and MANPADS. They also operate technicals and a very limited number of light armored vehicles. IEDs, mortar and rocket attacks are common.<br/><br/>
Our current area of control extends to: <br/>
FOB Pretoria, the company HQ, all rifle, stryker and air assault platoons are based here. A field hospital is also based here.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, if necessary, you may call on Close Air Support and CASEVAC assets using your long range radios.<br/>

TODO
- we should add more intelligence to positions ie if on roof, go prone, otherwise stand or crouch
- unit spawning based on infantry groups

- Not working on dedicated yet (some _logic error)
- Garbage Collector ("what happens with units on server after player discs") not testable because of not working on dedicated
- the last one is the "radically-delete-all-cqbunits-and-group-if-players-are-far"-failsafe garbagecollector

- Maybe this function could be interesting: CBA_fnc_setVarNet (https://dev-heaven.net/docs/cba/files/network/fnc_setVarNet-sqf.html)
- Local units and groups should be deleted and houses unspended if no players are near lets say 2000mtrs (failsafe to delete units that didnt despawn correctly)


regularspawn:
1. teleport 600mtrs near a red dot -> no units shall be spawned yet
2. teleport 500mtrs near a red dot -> units shall be spawned and guard/patrol
3. teleport 600mtrs away from red dot -> units shall stop patrolling and run to a house
4. Wait about 20-30 seconds --> all units (INCL. GROUP) should have been deleted
5. Repeat step 1. and 2.
6. teleport 2500mtrs away from red dot
7. Wait about 20 seconds --> all units (INCL. GROUP) should have been deleted

clearing-testcase is easy: Kill all units of a group, wait some seconds and wait until bodies are deleted and see if position wont spawn again.

If moving back in before they get despawned (so they have not reached their _endpos, where they would get deleted) they go back on patrol or housedefence
